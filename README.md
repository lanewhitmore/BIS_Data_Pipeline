## Context and Project

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is an international “bank for central banks”
supporting monetary and financial cooperation among its central bank owners around the
globe (BIS, 2023). Among its roles, the BIS compiles and publicly publishes statistics that
inform analysis of global financial stability and liquidy.

*BIS Pipeline* is a production-ready, automated data pipeline that extracts, loads, and transforms select BIS datasets, "surfacing" these for advanced analytics.
